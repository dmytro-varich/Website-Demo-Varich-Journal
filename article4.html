            Aging is an inevitable part of life, influenced by many factors such
            as lifestyle, environment, and genetics. However, the primary causes
            of aging are the accumulation of cellular damage caused by reactive
            molecules known as free radicals, and the shortening of
            telomeres — structures located at the ends of chromosomes that play a
            key role in cell division.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Free radicals</b> are unstable molecules formed in the body due
            to various factors such as UV radiation, environmental pollution,
            poor nutrition, or stress. They have unpaired electrons and seek to
            "steal" electrons from other molecules, damaging cells and causing
            oxidative stress. Oxidative stress leads to premature cellular
            aging, functional decline, and the development of various diseases,
            including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative
            conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Cell division</b> is the process by which one cell divides into
            two new cells. It is crucial for growth, tissue repair, and overall
            health maintenance. During cell division, DNA is copied so each new
            cell receives a full set of genetic information. However, with each
            division, the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes become shorter.
            Once telomeres become too short, cells lose the ability to divide,
            leading to aging and eventual cell death. This is one of the key
            biological processes driving aging.
          </p>
          <p>
            While aging cannot be stopped, it is possible to make dietary and
            lifestyle changes that slow down certain aging processes and reduce
            the risk of age-related diseases. This article presents a selection
            of foods that can help slow down aging.

                  ><b>Turmeric.</b> The main active compound in turmeric, curcumin, has
                  powerful cell-protective properties due to its strong
                  antioxidant effects. Turmeric activates certain proteins that
                  help slow down cellular aging and promote longevity. This has
                  been confirmed in animal <a class="additional-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6429134/">studies</a>, which showed that curcumin
                  combats cellular damage and significantly increases lifespan.
                  The compound has also been shown to delay the onset of
                  age-related diseases and alleviate their symptoms.</span

                  ><b>Collagen.</b> This popular dietary supplement may help prevent
                  skin aging by boosting collagen levels in the skin. As we age,
                  the production of collagen — a protein that helps maintain skin
                  structure — slows down, leading to visible signs of aging such
                  as wrinkles. Some <a class="additional-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7271718/">studies</a> suggest that collagen
                  supplementation can reduce signs of aging, including wrinkles
                  and dryness, and improve skin elasticity.</span

                  cellular protection. As we age, CoQ10 levels decline, which

          P.S. In this article, I’ve highlighted foods that can significantly
          contribute to slowing down the aging process. Of course, there are
          many other healthy foods that positively affect overall health.
          However, there are also other factors and nuances that deserve
          attention in a separate article. For example, it’s important to
          remember that excessive consumption of green tea or foods high in iron
          can be harmful, as iron may promote the formation of free radicals,
          leading to cell damage and premature aging. That’s why it’s essential
          to follow the principle: eat healthy foods, but in moderation.

            Turkey contains protein and several vitamins and minerals, such as
            riboflavin and phosphorus. It is also rich in the amino acid
            tryptophan, which promotes the production of melatonin. Fatty fish
            such as salmon, tuna, trout and mackerel are extremely beneficial
            due to their vitamin D content and omega-3 fatty acids, particularly
            EPA and DHA. The combination of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D in
            oily fish can have a positive effect on sleep quality, as both have
            been shown to promote serotonin production. Eating a few grams of
            turkey or fatty fish before bed can help you fall asleep faster and
            sleep more deeply, including fewer awakenings during the night.

            <b>Circadian rhythms</b> are natural biological fluctuations that
            occur roughly every 24 hours and regulate various physiological
            processes in the body. One of the main circadian rhythms is the
            sleep-wake cycle, which is controlled by an internal clock. These
            rhythms synchronize with the external environment, ensuring an
            optimal balance of activity and rest throughout the day, and they
            are essential for maintaining health and good-quality sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Sleep stages</b> are different phases characterized by varying
            depths and levels of activity. Sleep is typically divided into four
            stages: the falling asleep stage, which is the transition from
            wakefulness to sleep and lasts a few minutes; the light sleep stage,
            during which consciousness decreases and lasts about 20 minutes; the
            deep sleep stage, which is hard to wake from and important for
            physical recovery, lasting over 30 minutes; and the REM stage (rapid
            eye movement), the dreaming phase, which is vital for mental
            recovery and occurs several times a night, with increasing duration.
            The body goes through all these stages approximately 4 to 6 times
            per night, with each cycle lasting 90 to 110 minutes. A full night
            of sleep usually consists of several such cycles, totaling around 7
            to 9 hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Melatonin</b> is a hormone that regulates circadian rhythms and
            helps control sleep and wake cycles. Its level increases in darkness
            and decreases in light, signaling the body that it’s time to sleep.
            Melatonin plays an important role in dream regulation and affects
            sleep quality and the body’s recovery processes.

            Sleep schedule optimization involves having a regular routine for
            healthy circadian rhythms and better sleep. Relaxation before sleep
            includes techniques for calming the mind and making it easier to
            fall asleep. Nutrition and supplements refer to how food and
            supplements affect sleep quality. Sleep environment organization
            means creating a supportive space, taking into account lighting and
            setup.

                  ><b>Reduce blue light exposure in the evening.</b> While light
                  exposure during the day is beneficial, at night it has the
                  opposite effect. This is because it influences the circadian
                  rhythm, tricking the brain into thinking it’s still daytime.
                  As a result, it lowers the levels of hormones like melatonin,
                  which help you relax and enter deep sleep. Blue light is
                  mainly emitted in large amounts by lamps and electronic
                  devices such as smartphones and computers, making them the
                  worst offenders in this regard. There are several popular
                  methods to reduce blue light exposure at night. These include
                  using dim red lighting as night illumination, which is less
                  likely to shift the circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin;
                  wearing glasses that block blue light; stopping screen use two
                  to three hours before bed; or installing apps like <a class='additional-link' href="https://www.microsoft.com/sk-sk/p/flux/9n9kdphv91jt">f.lux</a> to
                  block blue light on your laptop or computer, as well as blue
                  light filter apps for your smartphone.</span

                  ><b>Reduce irregular or prolonged daytime naps.</b> Short naps
                  lasting 30 minutes or less can be beneficial, but long or
                  irregular naps may negatively affect your sleep. They can
                  disrupt your internal clock, making it harder to fall asleep
                  at night. However, if you already have a consistent and
                  restful night sleep, there’s no need to worry about daytime
                  rest. Sleep effectiveness is individual, and if you experience
                  difficulty falling asleep at night, consider limiting the
                  timing or shortening the duration of your daytime naps.</span

                  Your circadian rhythm, which aligns with sunrise and sunset,
                  supports better sleep quality. Following a regular routine can
                  positively affect the duration and quality of your sleep,
                  reducing the risk of disrupting your circadian rhythm and
                  melatonin levels. If you have trouble falling asleep, try
                  creating a routine with consistent wake-up and bedtime hours —
                  over time, this can become a natural habit that doesn’t even
                  require an alarm.</span

                  have confirmed that this can improve sleep quality and help
                  people, especially older adults, fall asleep faster. One study
                  found that taking a hot bath 90 minutes before bed enhances
                  sleep quality and promotes deeper sleep. It’s also worth
                  noting that a cold shower before sleep can contribute to
                  deeper and more restful rest. However, it’s important to
                  remember that extremely hot or cold showers are not
                  recommended for people with heart conditions. Experiment and

                  different strategies such as listening to calming music,
                  reading a book, getting a massage, taking a hot bath,
                  meditating, practicing deep breathing, or visualizing peaceful
                  scenes before bed. You can also consider taking a short walk
                  outdoors in the fresh air, which may help you relax and
                  improve your sleep quality. For even faster sleep, try the

                  relaxation process. Breathe deeply and slowly, focusing on
                  each inhale and exhale. Pay attention to every part of your
                  body—from head to toe—gradually relaxing each one. Use
                  visualization techniques by imagining yourself in a calm

                  notifications or enable “Do Not Disturb” mode to prevent
                  unexpected alerts. Remember that smartphones emit
                  electromagnetic waves, which can affect sleep quality. As an
                  alternative, use night mode and consider using wireless
                  headphones to listen to relaxing music or meditation tracks.
                  This can help create a calming atmosphere for falling asleep

                  While caffeine can be helpful for boosting focus and energy,
                  having it late in the day can harm your sleep. Research shows
                  that consuming caffeine even 6 hours before sleep can reduce
                  sleep quality. Its effects can last 6 to 8 hours, so it's best
                  to avoid large amounts after 3–4 PM, especially for those
                  sensitive to caffeine or experiencing sleep issues. As for
                  alcohol, it can trigger sleep apnea, disrupt your sleep cycle,
                  and reduce melatonin production. To maintain a healthy

                  can negatively affect sleep quality and the natural release of
                  growth hormone (HGH) and melatonin. It's important to avoid
                  large portions before sleeping, as they may lead to poor sleep
                  and hormonal imbalance. Instead, choosing light and healthy
                  snacks a few hours before bed can help improve sleep
                  quality.</span

                  ><b>Avoid drinking too much liquid before bedtime</b>, as
                  frequent nighttime urination—known as nocturia—can negatively
                  impact sleep quality and reduce your energy during the day.
                  It’s recommended to limit fluid intake, especially within 1–2
                  hours before going to bed, to reduce the risk of these
                  symptoms. Additionally, using the bathroom before sleep can
                  help lower the chances of waking up at night and improve
                  overall sleep quality.</span

                  ><b>Take supplements such as melatonin and others.</b>
                  Melatonin, the key sleep hormone, helps regulate your sleep
                  cycle and signals the brain when it's time to rest. In some
                  countries, melatonin requires a prescription, while in others
                  it’s widely available in stores or online. The recommended
                  dose is typically 1–5 mg taken 30–60 minutes before bedtime.
                  Other effective supplements include glycine (3 g), valerian
                  root (500 mg before bed), magnesium, L-theanine (100–200 mg
                  before bed), and lavender (80–160 mg). These can help enhance
                  relaxation and sleep quality. It’s important to try these
                  supplements one at a time and consider combining them with
                  other natural strategies to support healthy sleep.</span

                  night’s sleep. To optimize your bedroom conditions, try to
                  reduce outside noise, especially from traffic, control
                  lighting, and avoid artificial light from devices like alarm
                  clocks. Consider using earplugs to further block external
                  sounds and sleep masks to block out light. Make sure your
                  bedroom is quiet, calm, clean, and comfortable.</span

          In this issue, we explored the theoretical aspect of sleep, delving
          deeper into the nature of circadian rhythms, the stages of sleep, and
          the vital role of melatonin. We then outlined a series of practical
          tips and strategies aimed at improving sleep quality. It's also
          important to note that physical activity has a positive effect on
          sleep quality. However, it is better to exercise during the day rather
          than before bedtime to enhance nighttime rest. In my daily routine, I
          will incorporate several effective practices to improve my sleep.
          These include using a computer program to filter blue light, taking
          regular contrast showers to clear the mind, applying the U.S. Army’s
          military sleep method to fall asleep faster, turning off my phone
          during sleep to avoid notifications and electromagnetic waves, and
          maintaining a consistent sleep schedule—going to bed and waking up at
          the same time every day. I will also read books before bed and limit
          my intake of food and water in the evening to enhance sleep quality.
          In the next article, we will examine foods that may increase the risk
          of cancer and provide advice on how to avoid it. In writing this
          article, I used information from various online sources, with
          Healthline being the primary reference. Additional insights and
          support came from BetterUp, which discussed the benefits of hot and
          cold showers. I also took into account data from

          <p>
            <b>Cancer</b> is a genetically caused disease characterized by the
            uncontrolled division and spread of abnormal cells in the body.
            Genetic mutations can result from DNA damage to cells or inherited
            genetic defects, leading to disruptions in the mechanisms that
            regulate cell division.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Differences Between Healthy and Cancer Cells.</b> Normal and
            cancer cells are both formed daily through the process of cell
            division, which is necessary to replace damaged or old cells with
            new ones. However, the difference lies in the fact that normal cells
            have a limited number of divisions, known as the Hayflick limit,
            which is about 52 divisions. Additionally, normal cells can undergo
            apoptosis, a programmed cell death that removes damaged or
            unnecessary cells. The immune system recognizes and eliminates
            abnormal cells, but sometimes cancer can evade the immune response.
            As we age, the occurrence of genetic changes that cause cancer may
            increase the risk of developing the disease in older age, since the
            immune system gradually becomes less effective at fighting abnormal
            cells. Cancer cells are characterized by modifications in their DNA
            that lead to abnormal and continuous division, after which they can
            start invading and growing in other parts of the body. There is also
            benign tumors, which are not cancerous but can cause problems if
            located in critical areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Where Cancer Can Develop.</b> Cancer can develop in any part of
            the body, as there are more than 100 types of this disease, usually
            named after the organs or tissues where they begin. For example,
            lung cancer starts in the lungs, brain cancer in the brain, and
            carcinoma refers to cancer that forms in tissues. This means cancer
            can occur almost anywhere in the human body, including the blood.
            Additionally, cancer cells can spread throughout the body through a
            process called metastasis, where they break away from the primary
            site and move to other parts of the body. This complicates treatment
            and requires a comprehensive therapeutic approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>This article will cover two categories of foods:</b> those that
            may contribute to cancer development and those that are beneficial
            for its prevention. It is important to note that reducing the risk
            of cancer cannot be achieved through diet alone. Supporting the
            immune system plays a key role in the body’s ability to fight the
            growth of cancer cells. To do this, it is essential to avoid harmful
            habits such as smoking, stress, insufficient sleep, and drug use, as
            these factors can promote mutations and impair immune function.
            Among the healthy habits that help maintain immunity are a balanced
            diet, regular physical activity, avoiding harmful foods, and leading
            a generally healthy lifestyle.

              Processed meat includes any type of meat preserved through
              smoking, salting, curing, or canning. Most processed meats are red
              meats, which contain hemoglobin and myoglobin. When processed,
              these compounds can form carcinogenic substances such as
              nitrosamines. As a result, processed meat has been linked to an
              increased risk of various cancers, particularly colorectal,
              stomach, and prostate cancers.

              When starchy foods like potatoes, wheat, corn, rice, peas, and
              other grains or legumes are cooked at high temperatures — through
              frying, baking, roasting, or toasting — they produce a compound
              called acrylamide.

        <p class="author-text">
          P.S. As I reflect, I can’t help but summarize this rather extensive
          article. Cancer ranks as the second most common disease worldwide,
          surpassed only by cardiovascular diseases. Understanding what cancer
          is and how it develops is important to avoid misconceptions and to
          grasp its true nature. Everyone decides which foods to include or
          exclude from their diet to feel more at ease; however, it’s clear that
          the list of beneficial foods far outweighs the harmful ones, which is
          encouraging. Personally, my strategy would be to minimize the
          consumption of harmful products, particularly processed and red meats,
          fast food, alcohol, and sweets, since the latter cause many problems.
          When it comes to processed and fried foods, it’s a bit more
          complicated because I often cook with sunflower oil in a pan, making
          it hard to track the degree of processing. But I’ve found a solution:
          using olive oil, which has been shown to protect against breast and
          digestive tract cancers. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, it’s
          beneficial to boil or fry at low temperatures. To improve the
          nutritional value of my diet, I will definitely include vegetables
          such as cabbage, apples, citrus fruits, and carrots, and consider
          switching to fatty fish to diversify my meals. Since I mainly eat
          chicken, I also use beneficial herbs and spices in its preparation. I
          have also added other whole grains, like beet rice, to my food pyramid
          and am considering adding walnuts to my diet. As you can see, I’ve
          referenced numerous sources and studies confirming different aspects,
          but despite the abundance of information, it mostly boils down to one
          list of foods that can be either beneficial or harmful to health.
